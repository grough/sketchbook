# Generate a table of contents

Generate a table of contents from a Processing sketchbook by running the following:

```
% go run main.go /path/to/sketchbook
```

Or use this shortcut in the sketchbook root:
```
% make table_of_contents
```

The output of the program can be copied to the sketchbook's readme file.
