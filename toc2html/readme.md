# toc2html

Generate a table of contents for the Processing sketchbook. For each sketch, the sketch's filename is used as the title, and the first comment in the sketch is used as the description. A sketch will be omitted from the table of contents if it does not include a comment. The output of the program can be copied and pasted into the sketchbook's readme file.

## Usage

```
% go run main.go /Users/somebody/Documents/Processing
```
